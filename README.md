## Overview
The fourth project in my Campus 19 journey is get_next_line. This is a function that returns a line from a file descriptor.

## Mandatory
The function should read a file one line at a time and return the line it has just read. It should also work with a variable buffer size. We  can use helper functions but we cannot use our libft.

## Bonus
The function needs to work with multiple file descriptors and we can only use one static variable.

## Result
